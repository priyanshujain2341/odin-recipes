    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Dal Baati Churma is a quintessential dish from Rajasthan, India, embodying the essence of traditional Rajasthani cuisine. It consists of three distinct components: dal (lentils), baati (hard, round wheat rolls), and churma (a sweet crumbly mixture). The dal is a hearty and flavorful preparation of lentils—usually a mix of toor, chana, and moong dal—cooked with aromatic spices like cumin, mustard seeds, and turmeric. It is rich, mildly spiced, and serves as a comforting base for the meal. Baati is made by shaping whole wheat dough into balls, baking them until golden and crisp on the outside, and then smothering them in ghee (clarified butter), which enhances their flavor and provides a luscious texture.

        Churma adds a sweet finish to the dish, made by crushing baked or fried baati, mixing it with sugar or jaggery, and flavoring it with cardamom and nuts. This trio offers a perfect balance of textures and flavors—savory lentils, crumbly and buttery bread, and the sweet richness of churma. Traditionally served as a communal meal, Dal Baati Churma reflects Rajasthan's heritage of frugality and hospitality, using simple ingredients creatively to make a wholesome and indulgent feast. It is not just a meal but a celebration of flavors and traditions, often enjoyed during festivals and special occasions.

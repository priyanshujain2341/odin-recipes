    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Kaju Katli, also known as Kaju Barfi, is a popular Indian sweet made primarily from cashew nuts (kaju) and sugar. The cashews are ground into a fine powder, mixed with sugar syrup, and cooked into a smooth, rich dough that is then rolled out and cut into diamond-shaped pieces. Often, the pieces are adorned with a thin layer of edible silver leaf (varak), enhancing their aesthetic appeal and giving them a festive touch. The texture is soft and melts in the mouth, while the flavor is rich and nutty with a delicate sweetness that’s not overpowering.

        This treat is especially popular during festivals like Diwali, weddings, and celebratory occasions. Its minimal use of ingredients and lack of added flour or ghee (clarified butter) sets it apart from other Indian sweets, making it a slightly lighter dessert option. Kaju Katli is cherished for its luxurious taste and simplicity, symbolizing indulgence and celebration. Its preparation requires precision, which is why it’s often considered a premium sweet in Indian confectionery.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups cashews</li>
        <li>6 pods green cardamom</li>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ghee (clarified butter), or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Blend cashews in a grinder just until they're in powder form. Don't overblend or they will start releasing their oil; we want the powder to remain dry.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove green cardamom from the pods. Crush them into a powder with a mortar and pestle.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine sugar and water in a nonstick pan over medium-high heat. Cook until sugar has completely dissolved, then bring to a boil. Lower the heat to medium and add cashew powder; stir thoroughly, making sure there are no lumps. Continue to cook and stir until it becomes a little thick.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add crushed cardamom powder and ghee; keep mixing and cooking until mixture thickens and starts separating from the sides of the pan. If it doesn't release from the pan, add some more ghee and mix again; it should look moist and sticky and not at all dry. Check to see if it's done by taking a spoonful and cooling it a bit; when you mold it into a ball and the texture is like fudge, it's done.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer mixture to a greased or parchment-lined plate and let cool until only slightly warm. Grease your palms and knead on parchment paper on a flat surface to form a very smooth dough, 2 to 3 minutes. Roll evenly to a thickness of 1/4 inch.
        </li>
        <li>
            Let rolled dough cool completely. Cut kaju katli into desired shapes. Serve at room temperature or cold.
        </li>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Paneer Butter Masala is one of the most beloved dishes in Indian cuisine, known for its rich and creamy texture. The dish features soft cubes of paneer (Indian cottage cheese) simmered in a luscious tomato-based gravy, flavored with butter, cream, and a medley of spices. The sauce, made with ripe tomatoes, cashews, and aromatic spices like garam masala, cumin, and coriander, strikes a perfect balance between tangy, mildly sweet, and savory flavors. Its velvety texture and vibrant orange hue make it as visually appealing as it is delicious.
